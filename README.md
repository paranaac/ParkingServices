## Date: 9/15/2015

Software Engineering Project: Create a university parking registration system with SQL, ASP, C#

The Parking Services System (PSS) is a website that allows students and staff to register their vehicles for on-campus, update their car information, pay their parking fines, and maintain an active registration status. PSS also allows parking staff administrators to look up a students and staff, register new students and staff to the database, search users, issue parking citations, contact users through email, and check RS (Active or Expired).

The Parking Services System is a website that can be used to help effectively communicate information between Parking Services and students and faculty at Software University. This is a new software system designed to allow students and faculty to register vehicles with Parking Services, renew their registrations, add or update car information, and view their current status instantly, without having to wait in line at the Campus Services building. This website also allows parking services staff to keep a database of users previously or currently registered in their system, organize parking citations, have readily-accessible information about on-campus parking posted, and communicate with users via email.

#	Functional Requirements

1.	The user will call the parking services building and get a PIN number to register their account. They will need to provide the last 4-digits of their SSN to confirm their identity.

2.	The parking manager should have the ability to manually enter and validate user IDs with the corresponding PIN number.

3.	Administrators need the ability to search, filter, and sort the database by ID number.

4.	Administrators need the ability to view registered vehicles, and violations assigned to each user.

5.	Administrators need the ability to give a user a parking violation from a predefined list of violations using a drop-down list and their user ID.

6.	A balance greater than $0.00 should disable the student’s ability to renew their registration.

7.	The administrator should have the ability to search a list of registered cars by typing the user’s ID or Decal ID into the search box.

8.	The administrator should be able to view which student’s registration is expiring soon, which students have unpaid fines, and which students need to renew their information.

9.	The administrator should have the ability to contact all users whose registration meets the above criteria and send them all a reminder at the same time by gathering all their e-mail addresses using a checkbox.

10.	Students and faculty should have the ability to add new vehicles to their account, assigning them an unique decal ID for each vehicle registered.
